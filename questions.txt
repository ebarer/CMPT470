1. References to both /playlists and /playlist, which should be used?

2. What is the desired interface for adding a playlist? (No mockup)

3. Should the CSS file be "playlist.css" or "style.css", it was the former previously, but in this assignment you are requesting access to the latter

4. To set cache lifetime to 30 minutes, is this the correct syntax?

	response.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'max-age=1800');

5. Should back and forward work (and switch tabs?)
